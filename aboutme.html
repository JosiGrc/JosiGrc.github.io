		<p style="font-size:100%;">So you want to know more about me? Well look no further, I'll start by mentioning a bit from when I got here. When I was almost six I came to the US with my mom. I don't remember much except that the trip was long, hot, and full of people whom I never seen before. But enough about another immigrant story, let get to the juicy part, where I am now. See being the first of my family to graduate high school there was, and still is, pressure to not only graduate high school but also college with some sort of credentials that say "I worked hard for this." The thing was that it was a bit of a challenge for me just to graduate high school, get a good score on the ACT, and go to college. But I managed to graduate somehow, although the hard part was just beginning. I was so caught up trying to graduate that I forgot what I wanted to do with my life. Yeah my mom was constantly telling me study this or study that, many of which were easy and small in terms of credits needed. I did try one of her suggestions, Phlebotomy, which was not bad but the thought of interacting with people was not on my mind. Unfortunately I had figured that out too late, at least the books are interesting. After that I decided to save some money and work in a factory, but that was a rough in it of itself. I ended working at three factories total one of which I only a month because it was so hot and I was walking back and forth with a cart that would carry car transmissions.  The other too weren't half bad, other than the lack of air conditioning and doing the same thing every day for 40 hours a week, 50 if I was feeling greedy. After that was done with I wanted to go back to school but I didn't want to throw away money and time. So while I went through my options I decided it was time to move away from boring factory work and into sweet old air conditioning. Thus I started working at a famous Chinese fast food chain. It had its downs but that A/C was calling my name. But alas, things went downhill for the current employees and many left withing my first month of working there. Because of the shortage of workers I was scheduled for several 11 hour shifts back to back. Not only was the A/C keeping me there it was also the lack of money, because life likes to throw curve balls out of nowhere for no reason. But lady luck was on my side, on a beautifully cloudy day I checked my email and saw a beacon of light. It was as an email from devCodeCamp. it mentioned that they have ISA(----). I had tried to enroll once before a few years back but I couldn't because I was not approved for the loan, bummer. And yet here I am now, making my own website after two hours of learning HTML and CSS, I find it weird how opportunities present themselves, or in this case, appear in the promotions section of Gmail that I barely check.</p>
